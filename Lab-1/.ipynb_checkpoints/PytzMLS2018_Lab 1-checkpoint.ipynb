Every node in the decision trees is a condition on a single feature, designed to split the dataset into two so that similar response values end up in the same set. The measure based on which the (locally) optimal condition is chosen is called impurity. For classification, it is typically either Gini impurity or information gain/entropy and for regression trees it is variance. Thus when training a tree, it can be computed how much each feature decreases the weighted impurity in a tree. For a forest, the impurity decrease from each feature can be averaged and the features are ranked according to this measure."

    "Evaluating model perfomance using train/test split approach is very fast and  ideal for large datasets. It is recommended to use use this approach when the algorithm you are investigating is slow to train.

Testing accuracy can change a lot depending on a which observation happen to be in the testing set\n",

Cross validation is the process of training learners using one set of data and testing it using a different set. Parameter tuning is the process to selecting the values for a modelâs parameters that maximize the accuracy of the model.\n",
